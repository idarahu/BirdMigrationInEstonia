# BirdMigrationInEstonia

This Shiny application illustrates how measurements of weather radars of the [Estonian Environment Agency] (https://www.ilmateenistus.ee/ilm/ilmavaatlused/radar/#layers/precipitation,thunder) could be employed to analyse birds' migration. 
In the application, a toy dataset (measurements of SÃ¼rgavere radar from the 2nd of October at 6:00 UTC to the 3rd of October at 6:45 UTC in 2022) is used.
